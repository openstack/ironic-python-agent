    Ironic-Python-Agent versions prior to the 2023.1 release are vulnerable to
    CVE-2024-44082, tracked in
    `bug 2071740 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2071740>_`. Deployers of
    Ironic versions Zed or older must apply CVE-2024-44082 fixes to their
    Ironic environment and leave (default for all releases Zed and older)
    ``[conductor]/conductor_always_validates_images`` set to ``True``. This
    ensures the conductor will security check the image because
    Ironic-Python-Agent will not.
