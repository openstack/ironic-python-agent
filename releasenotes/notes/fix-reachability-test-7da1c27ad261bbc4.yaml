    Fixes an issue where the agent could not find a valid IP address when
    the Ironic API was running on a non-standard port. The reachability test
    now uses the full API URL including the port number, instead of only
    using the hostname. This prevents ``LookupAgentIPError`` when connecting
    to Ironic APIs on custom ports.
