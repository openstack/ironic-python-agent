    PReP (PowerPC Reference Platform) partition support is now deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release. This affects ppc64* (PowerPC 64-bit)
    hardware support. While POWER hardware remains an active platform, it
    represents a small, specialized share of typical ironic-python-agent
    deployment patterns.

    The feature was originally added to support booting partition images
    locally on PowerPC hardware, but usage in the ironic-python-agent
    ecosystem may be limited.

    Note that RAID support for PReP partitions was never implemented and
    will not be added before removal.

    Users with ppc64* hardware deployments should plan to migrate to
    alternative solutions or contact the Ironic community if they have
    specific requirements.
