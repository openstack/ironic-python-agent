    The agent now tests Ironic API URL reachability via HTTP during startup
    before determining the advertised IP address. Unreachable API URLs are
    filtered out, preventing the agent from advertising an IP address that
    cannot actually reach the Ironic API. This improves reliability when
    multiple API URLs are configured or in complex network topologies.
    The IP reachability test uses the configured ``http_request_timeout``
    (default 30 seconds) timeout for the HTTP request.
