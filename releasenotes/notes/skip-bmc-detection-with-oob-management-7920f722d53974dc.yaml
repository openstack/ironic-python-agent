features:
  - |
    Adds support for automatically skipping BMC detection via ipmitool
    when Ironic indicates the node uses out-of-band management interfaces
    (e.g., Redfish, iDRAC Redfish, iLO, iRMC). This reduces deployment
    time and avoids unnecessary ipmitool calls when the BMC information
    is already known to Ironic.
  - |
    BMC information (address, v6address, and MAC) is now cached after the
    first detection to avoid repeated expensive ipmitool calls during
    subsequent inventory collections. This improves performance during
    heartbeats and long-running operations like cleaning or rescue mode.
