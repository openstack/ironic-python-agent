    Adds an configuration option which can be encoded into the ramdisk itself
    or the PXE parameters being provided to instruct the agent to ignore
    bootloader installation or configuration failures. This functionality is
    useful to work around well-intentioned hardware which is auto-populating
    all possible device into the UEFI nvram firmware in order to try and help
    ensure the machine boots. Except, this can also mean any
    explicit configuration attempt will fail. Operators needing this bypass
    can use the ``ipa-ignore-bootloader-failure`` configuration option on the
    PXE command line or utilize the ``ignore_bootloader_failure`` option
    for the Ramdisk configuration.
    In a future version of ironic, this setting may be able to be overridden
    by ironic node level configuration.
