    Adds an additional check if the ``smartctl`` utility is present from the
    ``smartmontools`` package, which performs an ATA disk specific check that
    should prevent ATA Secure Erase from being performed if a pass-through
    device is detected that requires a non-ATA command signling sequence.
    Devices such as these can be `smart` disk interfaces such as
    RAID controllers and USB disk adapters, which can cause failures
    when attempting to Secure Erase, which may render the disk unreachable.
