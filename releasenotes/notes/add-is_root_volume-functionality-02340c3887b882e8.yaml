    Adds support for the ``is_root_volume`` property in software RAID
    configurations. The property can be set to True on a RAID volume to
    indicate that it should be used as the root device for OS installation.
    When set to False, the volume and the underlying physical devices
    and partitions are excluded from consideration as potential root devices.
    It defaults to None, which has no effect on root device selection.
