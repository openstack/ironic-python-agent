        Deploy steps are executed by similar logic to clean steps, but during

        * 61 to 79 - deploy steps to run after the image is written but before
          the bootloader is installed.
        * 41 to 59 - steps to run after the image is written and the bootloader
          is installed.

        If priority is zero, the step must be explicitly selected via
        an applied deploy template.

        Note that each deploy step makes deployments longer. Try to use clean
        steps for anything that is not required to be run just before an
        instance is ready.
